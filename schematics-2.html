			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>I call it luck. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
			<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>

				<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
