			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Designing NASA's new Space Launch System (SLS) is no small task, and engineers and contractors from across the agency have to exchange and review all manner of models, drawings, and more with one another. Their process wasn't going as expected. Things weren't being delivered on time and it was difficult to get everyone to sign off, causing tension within the organization. I led the research, information architecture, and design to create DEx, a web application to address some of SLS' biggest challenges.

		<section class="prefix-10 grid-80 suffix-10">
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Since retiring the Space Shuttle, NASA has been hard at work on a new human spaceflight vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS). To design and build the rocket, all manner of specialized engineers and contractors have to collaborate on, exchange, and review data artifacts with one another. These are things like environment models, trajectories, drawings, schematics, tables, and more. Each of these deliverables are dependent on one or more others, so it's important that data is completed and delivered on time. In addition, every deliverable needs to be signed off on by multiple different parties.</p>
			<p>To keep track of everything, the folks at SLS had come up with a process for requests, signatures, and deliveries. However, it was run by a single person inside an Excel spreadsheet of ever-increasing size and complexity. Nothing was working as expected. There were many bureaucratic silos and unclear requests. Things weren't getting delivered on time (if at all), and it took way to long to get everyone to sign off on things. While there was a process in theory, it wasn't really being followed, sewing discord, stress, and unhappiness throughout the SLS organization.</p>

			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<h3>User interviews</h3>
			<p>After a kickoff with our main clients, we traveled to Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, AL to do some interviews. I facilitated thirteen interviews with folks from different disciplines, elements, and roles in the process. Our research questions sought to answer who was involved in the process, what it looked like from each participants' perspective, frustrations and pain points, and any things that might be working well, if any.</p>
			<h3>Analyzing our notes</h3>
			<p>Rather than doing an affinity diagram, we tried out using Airtable to document and classify our notes. We thought it would save us some time and allow us to quickly add data and make associations. My colleague Stephen and I combed through our raw notes and pulled out "nuggets" that could stand on their own. We tagged each note as we went in order to pull out common trends. We went through rapidly and at the end a pretty good set of themes had emerged.</p>

		</section>
		<section class="prefix-10 grid-80 suffix-10">
			<h3>Determining the most critical opportunities</h3>
			<p>We quantified our data in two ways to filter out the most important opportunities. The first was a simple bar chart showing how many times a theme was mentioned. Nothing was too surprising, but we now had evidence to back up some of the frustrations we heard about when the project began.</p>
			<p>The second model we created was a "prevalence-severity matrix". I had used <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-matrices/">impact-effort matrices</a> in past projects to help prioritize work, and wondered if we could use something similar to further narrow our opportunities. On this chart, we plotted how often a theme came up against how severe it was. The severity, was, admittedly, a subjective measure based on the language our participants used and our previous domain knowledge. However, it offered a useful tool to get a sense of our top opportunities. </p>

			<h3>Workshopping project goals and design ideas</h3>
			<p>We travelled back out to Marshall, and I facilitated two workshops with our clients and a few other leaders from SLS. The first was to generate project goals, and the second was to explore design ideas.</p>
			<p>For the goals workshop, we did a simple brainstorm on sticky notes. In the second exercise, we got them drawing! I wanted to make sure our findings and the goals of our stakeholders were aligned. If there were goals or design ideas that didn't map clearly to our findings, we could analyze them further. We also wanted to make the process participatory and make folks feel included in the process. Making changes is a scary thing, so we worked hard to make sure everyone felt welcome in shaping the project.</p>

			<h3>Roles and user stories</h3>
			<p>We divided our user community into a few main roles: </p>
			<ul><li>	<b>Data creators:</b> These folks were the primary creators, requestors, and users of data artifacts.
			</li><li>	<b>Schedulers:</b> These folks are primarily responsible for tracking status and monitoring dates. Often overlaps with the "router" role.
			</li><li>	<b>Routers:</b> Primarily responsible for making sure data gets where it needs to go and coordinating the people involved in an exchange. Often overlaps with the "scheduler" role.
			</li><li>	<b>Approvers:</b> Responsible for signing off on deliveries. May overlap with the "data creator" role.
			</li></ul>
			<p>For each role, we wrote several user stories that combined everything we learned from our research and workshops. We used these user stories to scope the work for the first release.</p>

			<h3>Information architecture</h3>
			<p>My team's flagship product, Mission Assurance System, is a customizable platform that fits into a lot of NASA use cases. For many projects, it's a way to rapidly the meet our users' needs without spending too much time creating an entirely new piece of enterprise software. We decided that it would be a good fit for SLS as well.</p>
			<p>Even though we were building using our platform, we still needed to define a logical information architecture. We drew content from all the artifacts we had collected  (memos, the original Excel spreadsheet, and more) and our primary research in order to create our IA.</p>

			<h3>Usability testing and validation</h3>
			<p>With our information architecture and new process workflow in hand, I created a prototype environment of our product to put in front of users. We took our third trip to Alabama to test and validate the interface. I facilitated seven sessions where we sought to validate some of our concepts and get some light usability feedback. We provided our participants a different set of scenarios depending on what role they played in the process.</p>
			<h4>What needed work</h4>
			<ul><li>Most of our participants had process questions. We needed to change some vocabulary around in the system to make it more clear what every field was for.
			</li><li>About half our participants struggled with commenting. The concept of threading was particularly unclear.
			</li><li>We had provided a set of search results on the homepage for quick access, but they turned out not to be valuable. Most of our participants were looking for something more personalized.
			</li></ul>
			<h4>What went well</h4>
			<ul><li>The general concept, a web-based collaborative environment, went over well with 100% of our participants.
			</li><li>A majority of our participants commented on how easy it was to link records together, and we observed them completing the task in very little time.
			</li><li>We found that folks found it easy to determine what the status of a record was, as well do a search for everything in a particular status.

			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<h3>Reducing the number of days per cycle</h3>
			<p class="impact-number">15</p>
			<p class="impact-description">Days saved per review</p>
